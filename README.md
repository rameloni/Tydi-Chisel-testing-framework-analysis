# An analysis of available testing frameworks for Tydi-Chisel

This repository contains the results of an analysis of available testing frameworks for Tydi related projects. Specifically, an analysis on pure Chisel and [`Tydi-Chisel`](https://github.com/ccromjongh/Tydi-Chisel) by [Casper Cromjongh](https://github.com/ccromjongh) projects has been performed. 

[`Tydi-Chisel`](https://github.com/ccromjongh/Tydi-Chisel) by [Casper Cromjongh](https://github.com/ccromjongh).
 Specifically, simple Chisel and Tydi-Chisel designs have been tested.


Specifically, we are interested in the following questions:
- What are the available testing frameworks for Tydi-Chisel?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of each framework?.
